CAPTCHA systems have been widely deployed to identify and block fraudulent bot traffic. However, current solutions, such as Google reCAPTCHA, often require additional user actions and need to send the attestation data back to the server, raising privacy concerns. To address these problems, in this paper we present the first zero-knowledge proof based CAPTCHA system, \name, for mobile devices. \name is invisible to users and does not reveal any sensitive sensor data to the server. We demonstrate that bot traffic can be accurately discovered by studying the motion sensor outputs during touch events and propose several models to accomplish this task. For each model, we elaborate on the design of the zero-knowledge proof system and make the implementation open-source. Using public datasets and data collected from 10 participants, we evaluate the accuracy and time consumption of each model and choose the ideal model for mobile devices. Then, we integrate \name in Brave browser on both iOS and Android platforms and further test the usability. In addition, we demonstrate that \name can be further extended to protect against click farming. We show that \name does not require trust in operation system, app integrity, and is effective against replay attacks.
