\subsection{Bot Detection}

To prevent automated programs, or bots, from abusing online services, the widely adopted solution is to deploy a CAPTCHA system. The early form of CAPTCHA typically requires users to identify text from a distorted image. For Google reCAPTCHA, the most popular CAPTCHA service, user inputs are also collected to help Google digitalise printed documents~\cite{von2008recaptcha}. However, text-based CAPTCHA schemes have been proven to be insecure as machines achieved more than 90\% success rate in cracking these challenges~\cite{von2008recaptcha,yan2008low,5395072}. Another popular form of CAPTCHA is image-based.
