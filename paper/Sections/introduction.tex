\section{Introduction}

{\bf Aim.} 
We design a novel sensor-based privacy-preserving bot detection system for mobile devices, \name, using zero-knowledge proofs. \name achieves the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does not reveal any sensitive information to the server
    \item Does not introduce additional operations from the user
    \item Does not require trust on the app code
    \item Does not rely on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
\end{itemize}

{\bf Design.}


{\bf Contributions.}
We make the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a novel context-aware bot detection system that requires no additional user action.
    \item We are the first to design a ZKP based invisible CAPTCHA solution for both mobile apps and websites.
    \item We are the first to implement ZKP for several machine learning models and make it open source.
    \item We integrate our system into mobile Brave and benchmark the performance of several bot detection models.
\end{itemize}
