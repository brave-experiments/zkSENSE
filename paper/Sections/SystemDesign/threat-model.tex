\subsection{Threat Model}
We assume there is a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) in the mobile device that collects and signs sensor data.

The goal of an attacker is to fraudulently get more ad rewards via bot operations. The attacker has the following capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compromise the OS
    \item Modify the app code
    \item Run app in simulators
    \item Fake sensor outputs (but they cannot sign the data using TPM's key) 
    \item Know the client-side defence
\end{itemize}
